## Plugins

Let's start with a short list of my note taking related plugins that implement a specific feature and can be combined.

- [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one): Markdown language support
- [markdown lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint): Markdown linter tool
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): multi-language formatting tool, very good support for markdown
- [Markdown PDF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf): Markdown export PDF
- [Draw.io Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio): draw.io Flowchart Integration
- [vscode-mindmap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eightHundreds.vscode-mindmap): mind map integration (this is the fork version, but it's much better)
- [Excalidraw](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomdtr.excalidraw-editor): Whiteboard Integration
- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker): Word spell checker

> You may notice that some of these plugins have nothing to do with markdown, but they are still important for editing, for example the spell checker feature that was only recently implemented in Joplin (v1.4.\*) already exists in the existing VSCode plugins.
