# Why write this plugin for vscode

1. As a professional editor, the editing function of vscode is unmatched by the note-taking tool. For example, shortcut key support
2. Vscode is not only an editor, but also has a very large plug-in ecosystem, so it has already been implemented in markdown formatting, linter verification, pdf export and other functions. There is no need to re-create the wheel in the note tool - it is possible Is a square wheel
3. In fact, I have been using vscode to edit markdown documents, and git + vscode to store company-related documents. At the same time, joplin is also used to store personal notes, but after a while, I found that I need to edit vscode + the synchronization/search function of joplin.

So I wrote this plugin for people who have the same needs as me.
